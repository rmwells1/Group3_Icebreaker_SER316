A long time ago, in the 10th century, a large castle was built in Germany called the Eltz castle.
It was near current day Berlin Flughafen. 
There were many knights in this city, each of them being very wettbewerbsfaehig.
They usually gathered in the Biergarten.
One day, they were all dressed in lederhosen, and gathered in a circle for a war. 
Louder than the war songs was the barks of the Hunds.
As they were getting ready to start a fight, all of then sudden one knight went into the center and started eating a Apfelkuchen, and everyone else soon followed.
But then one knight suddenly pulled out his sword, and started to cut the the Apfelkuchen of the last Gebaeck dish into half.
Then, a very fair looking maiden came about, wearing a dirndel, and distracted all of the knights.
