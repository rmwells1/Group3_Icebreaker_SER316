A long time ago, in the 10th century, a large castle was built in Germany called the Eltz castle.
It was near current day Berlin Flughafen. 
There were many knights in this city, each of them being very wettbewerbsfaehig.
They usually gathered in the Biergarten.
One day, they were all dressed in lederhosen, and gathered in a circle for a war. 
Louder than the war songs was the barks of the Hunds.
As they were getting ready to start a fight, all of then sudden one knight went into the center and started eating a Apfelkuchen, and everyone else soon followed.
But then one knight suddenly pulled out his sword, and started to cut the the Apfelkuchen of the last Gebaeck dish into half.
Then, a very fair looking maiden came about, wearing a dirndel, and distracted all of the knights.
Every one started confessing their love for her, but it turned out she was just there for business, delivering more Apfelkuchen from her Baeckerei.
Once she left, the knights decided to reenter the castle and one of the complained that the castle should have klimaanlage. The other knights looked at him like he was crazy and decided to throw him in his room and placed a schloss on the door.
The schloss was not strong enough that the knight was able to break out of the room.
